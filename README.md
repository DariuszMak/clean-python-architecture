### Local configuration:

```commandline
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv venv
```

- On Unix or macOS, using the bash shell: `source venv/bin/activate`
- On Unix or macOS, using the csh shell: `source venv/bin/activate.csh`
- On Unix or macOS, using the fish shell: `source venv/bin/activate.fish`
- On Windows using the Command Prompt: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
- On Windows using PowerShell: `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

Or just set it in IDE as current environment and then:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```commandline
pytest
```

Run tests with coverage report:

```commandline
pytest . --cov=.
```

## Code autoformat

All in one:

```
pre-commit run --all-files ; mypy --strict .
```

Mypy

```commandline
 mypy .
```

Isort

```commandline
isort .
```

Black

```commandline
black .
```

Pre-commit

```commandline
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Installing pre-commit hooks

File ```.pre-commit-config.yaml``` contains the definition of checks that will be run during the pipeline deployment
phase. In order to keep the pipeline happy ;) (and also to make sure we conform to one, centrally defined coding
standard) every developer should install the pre-commit-hooks in their local environment to ensure that every commit
that is pushed to the remote repository passes the checks.

- first, install pre-commit library into your python environment:

```commandline
pip install pre-commit
```

- then, install ```pre-commit``` hooks defined in the ```.yaml``` file:

```commandline
pre-commit install
```

This should automatically detect and install all dependencies required by ```.pre-commit-config.yaml```, and also now
pre-commit will run automatically on every ```git commit```!

- unistall pre-commit:

```commandline
pre-commit uninstall
```

- run pre-commit for all files:

```commandline
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- update hooks:

```commandline
pre-commit install-hooks
```

- if you want to ignore errors from changes, use "n" flag:

```commandline
git commit -n -m "commit message"
```

## Running Docker container service

Use ```Makefile``` commands to invoke selected commands, or use all of them:

```commandline
make all
```

## Setup entire project from scratch (Windows)

Make sure, that everything is committed or stashed and (optionally):

```commandline
git reset --hard HEAD ; git clean -x -d -f
```

then

```commandline
.\setup_docker_from_scratch.bat ; .\setup_local_project_from_scratch.bat
```

or on Linux:

```commandline
./setup_docker_from_scratch.sh ; ./setup_local_project_from_scratch.sh
```
